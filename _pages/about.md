I am a Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo. Before moving to University at Buffalo, I was a Ph.D candidate in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Washington State University. My advisor is Dr. [Haipeng Cai](https://chapering.github.io/). My research interests are in Software Engineering and Software Security.

# Research Projects:

**Automatically Generating Proof-of-Vulnerabilities for Real-World Vulnerabilities** \
Large-scale real-world vulnerability databases such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) exist, yet reproducing these vulnerabilities remains challenging due to the lack of available proof-of-vulnerabilities (PoVs). In this project, we explore the automatic generation of PoVs for existing real-world vulnerabilities by leveraging relevant information such as vulnerability descriptions, vulnerable versions, and patching commits, which can then be utilized for validating vulnerability patches.

**Automated Adaptive Prompting Large Language Models for Real-World Software Vulnerability Analysis** \
Timely and effective vulnerability detection and patching is essential for cybersecurity defense, for which various approaches have been proposed yet still struggle to detect and patch vulnerabilities effectively for real-world projects. In this project, we explore how to leverage large language models and in-context learning to address key software vulnerability analysis tasks: identifying given types of vulnerabilities, discovering vulnerabilities of any type, and patching detected vulnerabilities.

**Automatically Generating Realistic Vulnerabilities for Vulnerability Analysis** \
Large-scale and realistic vulnerability datasets are essential for both benchmarking existing techniques and developing effective data-driven approaches for software security. In this project, we explore how to automatically generate realistic vulnerabilities by injecting vulnerabilities to the widely available real-world normal programs, through deep learning-based and pattern-based code editors.

**On the Open Science of Deep Learning-Based Vulnerability Detection** \
Open science is a practice that makes scientific research publicly accessible to anyone, hence is highly beneficial. Given that an increasing number of deep learning-based vulnerability detection approaches are explored, we exhaustively search the literature in this area and comprehensively investigate the four integral aspects of open science: availability, executability, reproducibility, and replicability.

**Evaluating and Comparing Memory Error Vulnerability Detectors** \
Memory error vulnerabilities have been consequential and several well-known, open-source memory error vulnerability detectors exist, built on static and/or dynamic code analysis. In this project, we conduct an empirical study that evaluates and compares state-of-the-art memory error vulnerability detectors against publicly available benchmark datasets of C/C++ programs, with case studies to gain in-depth explanations of successes and failures of individual tools.
