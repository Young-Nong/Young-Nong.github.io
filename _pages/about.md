I am an Ph.D student in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at Washington State University, Pullman. My advisor is Prof. [Haipeng Cai](https://chapering.github.io/). My research fields are Software Engineering and Software Security.

# Research Projects:

**Automatically generating realistic vulnerabilities for vulnerability analysis** \
Large-scale, realistic vulnerability datasets are essential for both benchmarking existing techniques and developing effective data-driven approaches for software security. In this project, we explore to automatically generate realistic vulnerabilities by injecting vulnerabilities to the widely available real-world normal programs, though deep learning-based and pattern-based code editors.

**On the Open Science of Deep Learning-Based Vulnerability Detection** \
Open science is a practice that makes scientific research publicly accessible to anyone, hence is highly beneficial. Given that an increasing number of deep learning-based vulnerability detection approaches are explored, we exhaustively search the literature in this area and comprehensively investigate the four integral aspects of open science: availability, executability, reproducibility, and replicability.

**Evaluating and comparing memory error vulnerability detectors** \
An empirical study that evaluates and compares state-of-the-art memory error vulnerability detectors against publically available benchmark datasets of C/C++ programs, with case studies to gain in-depth explanations of successes and failures of individual tools.
