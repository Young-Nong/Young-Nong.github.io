**[Open Science in Software Engineering: A Study on Deep Learning-Based Vulnerability Detection](https://young-nong.github.io/publications/)** \
**Yu Nong**, Rainy Sharma, Abdelwahab Hamou-Lhadj, Xiapu Luo, Haipeng Cai. *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 2022.* \
An empirical study that exhaustively searches the literature in the area of deep learning-based vulnerability detection and comprehensively investigates the four integral aspects of open science: availability, executability, reproducibility, and replicability.


**[Generating Realistic Vulnerabilities via Neural Code Editing: An Empirical Study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361835991_Generating_Realistic_Vulnerabilities_via_Neural_Code_Editing_An_Empirical_Study)** \
**Yu Nong**, Yuzhe Ou, Michael Pradel, Feng Chen, Haipeng Cai. *ACM Joint Meeting on European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering (ESEC/FSE), 2022* \
A study that explores the feasibility of vulnerability injection through neural code editing. With a synthetic dataset and a real-world one, we investigate the potential and gaps of three state-of-the-art neural code editors for vulnerability injection.

**[Evaluating and comparing memory error vulnerability detectors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351374599_Evaluating_and_comparing_memory_error_vulnerability_detectors)** \
**Yu Nong**, Haipeng Cai, Pengfei Ye, Li Li, Feng Chen. *Information and Software Technology, 137, 106614. 2021* \
An empirical study that evaluates and compares state-of-the-art memory error vulnerability detectors against publicly available benchmark datasets of C/C++ programs, with case studies to gain in-depth explanations of successes and failures of individual tools.

**[A Preliminary Study on Open-Source Memory Vulnerability Detectors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340402566_A_Preliminary_Study_on_Open-Source_Memory_Vulnerability_Detectors)** \
**Yu Nong**, Haipeng Cai. *IEEE 27th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER) (pp. 557-561). 2020* \
Preliminary results of a study on memory vulnerability detectors based on (static and/or dynamic)program analysis, against a public suite of 520 C/C++ programs as benchmarks which cover 14 different vulnerability categories.
